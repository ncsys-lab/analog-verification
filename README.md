# Analog Verification Pipeline

## Current Pipeline

The current pipeline is split into two parts:
* analog behavioral models: `models`
* an msdsl-to-verilog optimizing pass: `docker`

The analog behavioral models can be generated using a Python frontend, as in
`ode/main.py` (which is also `models/vco.py`).

### Differential Equation Frontend

The frontend in `ode/main.py` converts a behavioral model specified as a
differential equation into verilog, via [msdsl](msdsl) and [svreal](svreal).

It relies on the Python packages specified in `docker/requirements.txt`, which
are `msdsl`, `svreal`, and `sympy`.

### Docker

The Docker container wraps up a couple of different steps:
1. running the Python script provided over `stdin`, which should produce valid
   SystemVerilog that includes `svreal.sv` and `msdsl.sv`
2. converting the SystemVerilog to Verilog
3. converting the Verilog to FIRRTL
4. converting the FIRRTL to optimized SystemVerilog (using [LLVM
   `firtool`](circt))
5. converting the SystemVerilog back to Verilog
6. outputting the Verilog over `stdout`

It expects the name of the top-level module to be specified in the
`$MODEL_NAME` environment variable.  For example:

    docker run -e MODEL_NAME=vco -i msdsl-optimizer < input.py > output.v

This uses the versions of msdsl and svreal from
[msdsl-examples](msdsl-examples), which are modified to be synthesizable in
Yosys.

Sometimes `firtool` will reject a circuit produced by MSDSL.  In this case the
FIRRTL step can be skipped by adding `-e USE_FIRRTL=false`, at the cost of a
less optimized circuit.  The circuit is still optimized to some extent by
`yosys`.

## Old Pipeline: `pipeline`

This performs similar steps to the Docker pipeline, but uses a Makefile for
incremental compilation.  This folder additionally contains testbenches, both
for simulation with `iverilog` and verification with `btormc`.

## Fixture Setup: `fixture-setup`

This contains an incomplete Dockerfile to run [`fixture`](fixture), which can
extract a behavioral model from a component-level description of an analog
circuit.  It can be run on the provided examples thus:

    cd fixture-setup
    docker build . -t fixture
    docker run -it -v.:/data fixture ctle.yaml

It uses `/data` as the working directory within the container.

## GDS to SPICE netlist flow

Contained in folder gds2spice, there is a makefile which extracts a spice netlist from a user-provided gds file. At the current moment, running this tool requires Magic and the skywater PDK to be installed on your computer. You may use install_sky130_and_magic.sh to install magic and the sky130 PDK, but it takes about 30 minutes to install and requires about 25Gb

To use this flow, you must run `make <GDS NAME>.spice` in the folder gds2spice. The folder must contain your gds file. Additionally, you must set your environment variable in the given Makefile. You can either do this by executing the command `export PDK_ROOT=<path-to-sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech>` before running `make` or by changing the line in the Makefile
